# International DateTime

##### International datepicker for Laravel Nova

Apply localisation to Laravel Nova's default `DateTime` field that currently doesn't support localisation out of the box.

## Installation

You can install the package in to a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:

```bash
composer require techouse/intl-date-time
```

## Usage

The API is adapted from [Nova's default `DateTime` Field](https://nova.laravel.com/docs/1.0/resources/fields.html#datetime-field).

The module itself offers 3 optional configurations:
* `locale` - _OPTIONAL_ -  With this you can define the module's locale. If you do not it will automatically use your app's `config('app.locale')`. If you supply an unsupported locale it will default to British English `en-gb`,
* `dateFormat` - _OPTIONAL_ - With this you can define a date format. If you do not provide it the module will automatically use the appropriate locale's date format. The format must be [MomentJS compatible](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/)!
* `timeFormat` - _OPTIONAL_ - With this you can define a time format. If you do not provide it the module will automatically use `HH:mm:ss`. The format must be [MomentJS compatible](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/)!

Simply use `IntlDateTime` class instead of `DateTime` directly or alias it like the example below so you won't have to refactor too much existing code.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Nova;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Laravel\Nova\Fields\{ID, Password, Select, Text};
use Techouse\IntlDateTime\IntlDateTime as DateTime;

class User extends Resource
{
    /**
     *  This is how you use and configure this module
     */
    public function fields(Request $request)
    {
        return [
            DateTime::make(__('Updated at'), 'updated_at')
                    /**
                     * The module automatically uses your app's locale 
                     * from config('app.locale'), however you can manually
                     * override this by setting it like this.
                     * 
                     * IMPORTANT: Check the list of supported locales below in this readme!
                     * 
                     * NOTE: If the automatic locale is not supported by MomentJS 
                     * the module defaults to 'en-gb' (British English).
                     */
                    ->locale('sl'),
                    
            DateTime::make(__('Created at'), 'created_at')
                    /**
                      * You can optionally set a custom DATE format.
                      * 
                      * It has to be compatible with MomentJS!!!
                      * https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/
                      */
                    ->dateFormat('d.m.Y'),   
                    
            DateTime::make(__('Deleted at'), 'deleted_at')
                    /**
                      * You can optionally set a custom TIME format
                      * 
                      * It has to be compatible with MomentJS!!!
                      * https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/
                      */
                    ->timeFormat('HH:mm'),
        ];
    }

    /**
     * The rest of the Resource ... bla bla bla :)
     */
}

```
